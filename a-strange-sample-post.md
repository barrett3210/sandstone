I am trying out writing some text in Markdown for this. More text to try this thing out.  There needs to be a longer paragraph.  Why does Atom not wrap the text sooner?

## A lovely day today, sir

Now it is morning in the city.  Nice to meet you.  Have a nice day!

### How are you?

I am fine, and you?  If you are fine, I hope you stay fine.

Does it make a difference if I leave a space in between the paragraphs?

### Code samples

A code sample:

```python
letters = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
for letter in letters:
    print(letter)
```

now more text

### lists

And we can make a list:
* above
* across
* after
* against
* along
* among
* around
* at
* before
* behind
* below

And now for an image:
